# Github Automation Script
## Background
This project demonstrates the application and usages of git using Nodejs. It is simply performed with the intent for my own educational and learning purposes. 
## Performance
This project demonstrates a script written in JavaScript that automates the creation of Git commits with randomized timestamps. The script uses the jsonfile, moment, and simple-git libraries to achieve this functionality.

## Features

Automated Commit Creation: The script generates a specified number of commits (n) programmatically.
Randomized Timestamps: Each commit is assigned a unique, randomized timestamp within a specific range.
Push to Repository: After generating the commits, the script pushes them to the remote repository.

## Requirements

To use this script, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v12 or higher recommended)
Git (installed and properly configured)

## Libraries Used

jsonfile: For reading and writing JSON files.
moment: For date manipulation and formatting.
simple-git: For interacting with Git programmatically.
